**Problem__1**
You are given a 3 digit number. You have to output whether it is an armstrong number. 
A number is called an Armstrong number if the sum of the cubes of its digits equals the number itself.
For example 370 = 33 + 73 + 03

**Sample Input**                  **Sample Output**

370                                Armstrong Number

153                                Armstrong Number

123                                Not Armstrong Number

**Problem_2**
Given four coordinates a, b, c and d, output whether ab and cd are coincident, parallel or intersecting
(coordinates of a, b, c and d are given on separate lines in order).
